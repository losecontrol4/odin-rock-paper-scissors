# odin-rock-paper-scissors

I did this project as part of the Odin Project. There is currently no css in this project, although I may considering creating a fun design at a later date. The point of this project is show simple logic in javascript, as well as DOM manipulation.

The prompt called for playing to five games, and then asking to play again. While I planned for that to work, I chose against it because I had more fun having an endless war against the computer.
